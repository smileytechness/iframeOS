    http: `**BROWSER ERROR**

MIXED CONTENT error. When loading a secure webpage (HTTPS) that tries to access a non-secure server (HTTP), browsers block this as a security risk. This is called a Mixed Content error.

**What you'll see:**
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Server URL is secure or website is running locally
- ðŸ”´ Red: Mixed Content error detected

**How to fix:**
1. Add your server URL to Chrome's security exceptions:
   \`chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure\`
2. Restart Chrome after making this change

Note: This check happens instantly as it's a browser-level security check.`,
    
    lan: `**NETWORK ISSUE**

No response from server. This checks if your computer can reach the Ollama server on your network. Common when trying to access Ollama running on another machine.

**What you'll see:**
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Server is accessible
- ðŸ”´ Red: Cannot connect to server
- âš« Grey: Check skipped due to HTTP error

**Common Error:**
"Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"

**How to fix:**
1. For Ollama servers, set \`OLLAMA_HOST="0.0.0.0"\`
2. On macOS, run: \`launchctl setenv OLLAMA_HOST "0.0.0.0"\`
3. Restart Ollama from the app (not command line)`,
    
    cors: `**SERVER ISSUE**

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a server security feature that controls which websites can access it. The server needs to explicitly allow this website.

**What you'll see:**
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Server allows access
- ðŸ”´ Red: Server blocks access
- âš« Grey: Check skipped due to previous errors

**Common Error:**
\`Access to fetch at 'http://serverURL:11434/v1/chat/completions' has been blocked by CORS policy\`

**How to fix:**
Configure your Ollama server to allow this website:
- Set \`OLLAMA_ORIGINS\` to include this website's URL (https://iframeos.com)`
